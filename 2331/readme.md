# Week Year

## Deep context via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) ü§ì

### What is a week year?

A date and time standard issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) since 1988. This was previously known as ‚Äúindustrial date coding.‚Äù The system specifies a week year atop the Gregorian calendar by defining a notation for ordinal weeks of the year.

In every cycle there are 71 years with an additional 53rd week, corresponding to the Gregorian years that contain 53 Thursdays. An average year is exactly 52.1775 weeks long.

Anyways, I‚Äôve been using week year shorthand to organize my work since 2014.

This page is both a personal aid and an invitation to try it out.
